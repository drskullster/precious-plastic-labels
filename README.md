# Precious Plastic Labels

Optimized version of the labels found in the Precious Plastic kit. For original file and much, much more see https://preciousplastic.com/en/videos/download.html

The original PDF has two problems :

  * Headers take a large part of the page, which is a waste of valuable space when printed on expensive label sheets
  * Plastic types are all mixed, which means that you're stuck with all of them, even if you don't plan to shred some of the types

This version fixes those problems: there are 9 medium labels and 12 small labels per page, and each type has its own page.

## Export

PSD source file is included. Every page are packed in one file and organized in layer group for small and medium labels.

To export every group to a multi-page PDF, I used a featured called layer comp. With that you can create a snapshot of
the layers visibility (one for each page) and then export it with `File > Export > Layer Comps to PDF...`.

## Gotcha

In the process of copy-pasting labels from original PDF to a new PSD, assets have been rasterized.
It means that it's optimized for print on a A4 paper size, not bigger.

If you need a bigger format, use the file included in the Precious Plastic download kit (see link above).
